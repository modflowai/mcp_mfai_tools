# FloPy Modules Conceptual Grouping

## Current Working Categories

Based on mathematical differential equation approach and intuitive workflow, we're considering these core primitive categories for organizing FloPy modules:

### 1. **Discretization** 
- Spatial grid/mesh definition
- Time stepping and temporal structure
- *Note: Time discretization might need separation due to complexity*

### 2. **Properties** 
- All assigned attributes to discretized elements
- Hydraulic conductivity, porosity, storage coefficients
- Any other values assigned to cells/elements

### 3. **Initial Conditions**
- Starting values for transient simulations
- Initial heads, concentrations, temperatures

### 4. **Boundary Conditions** 
- All constraints on the differential equation
- Dirichlet (specified head)
- Neumann (specified flux - wells, recharge, drains)
- Cauchy/Robin (mixed conditions - rivers, general head boundaries)

### 5. **Solver Configuration**
- Numerical solution settings
- Convergence criteria, solver options

### 6. **Observations**
- Calibration targets and monitoring points
- Head observations, flow observations

### 7. **Post-processing**
- Results analysis, visualization, interpretation
- Budget analysis, particle tracking, exports

## Notes

- **Properties** chosen over "Material Properties" to stay primitive/general
- **Boundary Conditions** mathematically includes all sources/sinks (wells, recharge, etc.)
- **Time Discretization** may need separation from spatial discretization for intuitive organization
- This is a starting framework for manual review of 89 MF6 modules

## Analysis Target

Manual review of 89 MF6 modules from flopy_modules table to validate and refine these categories based on actual module functionality and user workflow patterns.
