# MFAI Model Builder Vision: YAML-Driven UI/Agent Collaboration

## Executive Summary

A revolutionary approach to groundwater modeling where a VSCode extension UI and an AI Agent collaborate through YAML as their universal language. This creates a Git-native, version-controlled modeling workflow that combines the familiarity of GUI interfaces with the intelligence of AI assistance.

## Core Concept: "Both Speak YAML"

The fundamental insight is that YAML serves as the contract between human interfaces and AI agents:

- **UI reads/writes YAML** → Visual interface for humans
- **Agent reads/writes YAML** → AI-powered enhancements
- **Git tracks YAML** → Full version control and history
- **YAML IS the model** → Single source of truth

## The Problem We're Solving

### Current Challenges
1. **MODFLOW GUIs are rigid** - Fixed interfaces, no AI assistance
2. **Code-based modeling is complex** - Steep learning curve, error-prone
3. **No collaboration between UI and AI** - Separate worlds
4. **Complex packages (like SFR) have 50+ parameters** - Overwhelming for users
5. **No version control in GUIs** - Can't track changes or rollback

### Our Solution
- **Dynamic UI from YAML** - Interface adapts to user needs
- **AI Agent assistance** - Intelligent parameter suggestions
- **Git-native workflow** - Every change tracked
- **Progressive disclosure** - Show only what's needed
- **Bidirectional editing** - UI changes update YAML, YAML changes update UI

## Architecture: YAML as Universal Truth

```yaml
# model.prd.yaml - This file IS the model AND the interface
version: "1.0.0"
created: "2025-01-08T10:00:00Z"
modified_by: "UI"  # or "Agent"

interface:
  title: "Springfield Aquifer Model"
  layout: "wizard"
  
  actions:
    - button:
        label: "Add Wells"
        icon: "water-well"
        action: "add_package"
        package: "WEL"
    
    - button:
        label: "AI Optimize"
        icon: "sparkles"
        action: "agent_optimize"
        _added_by: "Agent"
        _reason: "Complex model could benefit from optimization"

model:
  packages:
    DIS:
      nlay: 3
      nrow: 100
      ncol: 100
      _metadata:
        added_by: "UI"
        modified_by: "Agent"
        agent_note: "Refined grid near wells"
```

## Key Innovation: Parameter Classification System

Instead of subjective "essential vs advanced" categorization, we use objective, data-driven classification based on MFAI analysis:

### Classification Tiers
1. **Required (No defaults)** - User must specify
2. **Common (>70% usage in tutorials)** - Shown by default
3. **Scenario-dependent (30-70% usage)** - Shown conditionally
4. **Specialized (<30% usage)** - Hidden in advanced mode

### Discovery Method
```python
# Analyze actual usage patterns from MFAI
- Parameter frequency across FloPy workflows
- Default value analysis (has default = less critical)
- Documentation mentions
- User scenario correlations
```

## Workflow: The Collaboration Dance

### 1. User Creates Initial Model (UI)
```yaml
# User clicks buttons, fills forms
packages:
  DIS:
    nlay: 3
    nrow: 100
    _metadata:
      added_by: "UI"
      timestamp: "2025-01-08T10:00:00Z"
```

### 2. Agent Analyzes and Suggests (Agent)
```yaml
# Agent detects wells near river, suggests SFR
packages:
  SFR:  # Agent adds this
    nreaches: 10
    packagedata: [...]
    _metadata:
      added_by: "Agent"
      reason: "Detected wells within 500m of river"
      confidence: 0.85
```

### 3. User Reviews and Modifies (UI)
```yaml
# User accepts SFR but adjusts Manning coefficient
packages:
  SFR:
    nreaches: 10
    manning: 0.045  # User changed from 0.035
    _metadata:
      added_by: "Agent"
      modified_by: "UI"
      modification: "Adjusted Manning for rocky streambed"
```

### 4. Git Tracks Everything
```bash
git log --oneline model.prd.yaml
# 5a3f2d1 UI: Adjusted Manning coefficient for rocky streambed
# 4b2c3e2 Agent: Added SFR package for stream-aquifer interaction
# 3d1a4f3 UI: Created initial model with DIS, NPF, IC
```

## Revolutionary Feature: YAML-Defined UI

The YAML doesn't just store data - it defines the entire interface:

```yaml
interface:
  panels:
    - id: "packages"
      title: "Model Packages"
      position: "left"
      width: 300
      
  toolbar:
    - tool: "add_well"
      config:
        mode: "click_to_place"
        default_rate: -100
    
  conditional_ui:
    - condition: "packages.WEL.exists && packages.WEL.near_river"
      show:
        - button: "Add Stream Network"
        - panel: "stream_configuration"
```

This means:
- **UI configuration is version controlled**
- **Agent can safely modify UI through YAML**
- **Users can share their UI setups**
- **No compilation needed for UI changes**

## Safety Mechanisms

### Protecting Against Agent Errors
1. **Agent works in branches** - Never directly on main
2. **Validation before merge** - UI validates agent changes
3. **Rollback capability** - Git history allows instant rollback
4. **Protected core** - Critical structure cannot be modified

### Example Protection Flow
```typescript
// Agent proposes changes in branch
git checkout -b agent-suggestions
// Make changes to model.prd.yaml
git commit -m "Agent: Added SFR package"

// UI shows diff for review
// User approves/rejects
// Only approved changes merge to main
```

## Use Case: Complex Package Management

### The SFR Package Challenge
- 50+ parameters in SFR package
- Most users need only 5-10 parameters
- But which ones depend on context

### The Solution
```yaml
packages:
  SFR:
    # Agent determines what to show based on context
    _ui_hints:
      show_basic: ["nreaches", "packagedata", "connectiondata"]
      show_if_transient: ["initialstages", "perioddata"]
      show_if_managed: ["diversions"]
      hide_unless_advanced: ["maximum_picard_iterations", "dev_storage_weight"]
    
    # Actual values
    nreaches: 10
    packagedata: [...]
    # Advanced parameters hidden but available
```

## The Dream State

A modeler opens VSCode and types: **"I need to model contamination from a landfill near a river"**

The system:
1. **Agent creates initial YAML** with appropriate packages
2. **UI renders forms** for user input
3. **User fills in specifics** through familiar interface
4. **Agent suggests optimizations** via YAML updates
5. **Git tracks everything** with clear attribution
6. **Model runs successfully** first time

All through a beautiful UI that feels familiar yet is powered by AI intelligence, with YAML as the reliable contract between human creativity and machine intelligence.

## Technical Requirements

### VSCode Extension
- TypeScript/React for UI components
- YAML parser/validator
- Git integration via VSCode API
- WebView for complex forms

### AI Agent
- Access to MFAI database

- JSON Schema for YAML validation

## Success Metrics

1. **Adoption**: Modelers prefer this over traditional GUIs
2. **Quality**: Fewer model errors, better documentation
3. **Speed**: 50% faster model development
4. **Learning**: New modelers successful within days
5. **Collaboration**: Active template/workflow sharing

## Conclusion

This vision represents a paradigm shift in groundwater modeling interfaces. By making YAML the universal language that both UIs and AI agents speak fluently, we create a powerful, flexible, and safe environment for model development. The combination of visual interfaces, AI intelligence, and Git-native workflows addresses every major pain point in current modeling practice.

The key insight: **YAML isn't just data - it's the entire application specification**, enabling unprecedented collaboration between human creativity and machine intelligence in groundwater modeling.
